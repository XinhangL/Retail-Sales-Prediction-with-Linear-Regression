# 🛍️ Retail Sales Prediction with Linear Regression

This project was originally completed as the final assignment for the course **ALY6020 (Spring 2021)**. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and linear regression modeling to predict retail sales.

Re-visiting now for learning Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict `Total Net Sales` using other variables in a retail sales dataset
- **Dataset**: `dataset.csv` (structured transactional data)
- **Approach**:
  - Handle missing values
  - Standardize categorical values
  - Create dummy variables for regression
  - Train/test split and modeling with `LinearRegression`
  - Performance evaluation on test set

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Data cleaning using `pandas`
- Missing value imputation (by mode)
- Categorical feature encoding using `get_dummies()`
- Train-test split with `sklearn`
- Linear Regression model training and evaluation

---

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

---

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook: `ALY6020 Final Project.ipynb`
2. Ensure the CSV file `business.retailsales.csv` is in the same directory
3. Run all cells in order
